<h4>Hello Alpha Testers!</h4>
<p>You are very brave indeed to be helping out at this stage of the game, but as we only have a few days left for the Mozilla Game 
  On Competition, your help is essential!<p>
    
<h4>What to do</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    Vist <a href="http://whisperstorm.com/canvasquest2/canvasquest.html">http://whisperstorm.com/canvasquest2/canvasquest.html</a> and try out the game. It should work on Chrome and Firefox 4. 
    There's not much there right now except a single level and the ability to load and save a game. I've been spending a ton of time 
    on the editor and now in the next few days I'll be making lots of levels.
    </li>
    <li>
      Try out the level editor here: <a href="http://whisperstorm.com/canvasquest2/editor.html">http://whisperstorm.com/canvasquest2/editor.html</a>
      Basically you start with the tiles, then add the monsters, then add the items and events. To add a treasure you have to add both a 
      treasure tile as an item, and go into the events and add a treasure event on the same tile. Once you are done, copy and paste the
      resulting text into a js file. Go into the game and press "l" or "L" when in a map view. then type in the full http url pointing to the
      map js file you created online somewhere.
       </li>
  </ol>

<p>There are many things to finish, but the main ones are 
  1) build out the game levels 
  2) allow the player to buy items 
  3) switches for doors, etc
  4) end-game description
  5) tie the editor into the game (at the end).
