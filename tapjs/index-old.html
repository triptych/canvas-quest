      <h1>CanvasQuest</h1>
      <p>CanvasQuest is an HTML5-based roguelike game that places you in the role as Foobar the Bazbarian. You must save the 
        princess Wynn from a mysterious illness by finding the Magic Canvas. This Canvas has the ability to make real whatever is 
        painted upon it. The finest artist of the land - Leonardo - has been called upon to paint the princess as completely well.
        The King has asked you to travel to the Dungeon of Doom to fetch the Canvas and restore his daughter to health!
